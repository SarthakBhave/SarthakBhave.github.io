### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Introduction
I am Sarthak Bhave. Technically I am a second-year Computer Engineering student at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology. I am a keen learner and a lavish programmer more of interested in learning and making my stuff. Basically, I am a Hackathon enthusiast since I learned a lot from my seniors and I love to be a part of the community. In the pandemic, I started my journey with various courses of coding and programming in order to build something innovative in time boundary and grew a great knowledge for cloud computing. It helps me to learn new things and apart from that I could know my limits, mistakes, knowledge. I am looking forward to be a thriving coder and worker at my stuff. Building new things and debugging code is my daily good habit.
